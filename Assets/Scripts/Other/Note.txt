These scripts are for the camera path I use in the Input calculation scene, and the online tutorial from CatlikeCoding http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/curves-and-splines/ that some of it’s systems rely on.

While fun these scripts are messy and not made to be readable, like the other scripts in this project, and are only here because I wanted to use them practically.

Basically they’re a complex mess, not worth messing with.
